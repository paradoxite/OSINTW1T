@S3Partners Oh one more thought, alot of shares will be bought up tomorrow because of exercised option, so it's in their interest to spoof data.  I would side with your report if Friday volume was alot higher but it wasnt, so that's a peer review red flag.
@twitone @MGreenWriting “Mansplaining” is an overused word, but this is the real thing. It almost reads like a spoof.

BBC1's Summer Saturday morning kid's show On The Waterfront had a banger of a theme. It had comedy sketches &amp; was funny!

This spoof video promoting why Scotland should join England to create the UK is ridiculous...yet all so true too.
He was made to be a spoof of the archetypal Lovecraft hero (Lovecraft is the only author I know who saw heroic material in septuagenarian college professors). Akeley and Wilmarth are the main characters in 'The Whisperer in Darkness' (1931).   https://t.co/PFLEEDSZME

@Ameetdmello @Spoof_Junkey @ANI Atleast talk some sense bro. 3 times CM, 2+ times PM and many other small credibility in his name. RaGa did nothing.

Venture Bros, of which Ben Edlund was a writer and almost co-creator, is more or less The Tick's spiritual successor. It started off as a Jonny Quest spoof and it quickly took a life of its own.
@Spoof_Junkey @narendramodi Editing 😂😂👏
Most superhero parodies of its kind rely primarily on straight spoofs delivered as MAD Magazine-style joke machines, but The Tick focused instead of exploring its own brand of weirdness. It did a Daredevil/Elektra spoof on its first arc, then it started doing its own thing.

As a fiction writer i can tell you, no publisher would accept a novel written with the plot lines of 2020 - 21, except as a spoof. Plausibility is a necessary ingedient in good fiction. Reality operates under no such restrictions.  https://t.co/hrfyBL9tRO

Actually ye conspiracy thi to make this emotional song after bumper defeat to hide the incompetence of our beloved Chachaji n chacha cried after the performance. Next day headlines weren’t about defeat but were “Nehru cried”, “Bharat ka Lal roya” so in a way takkal is right.

The song 'Ae mere watan ke logo'  commemorates Indian soldiers who died during the Sino-Indian War in 1962. But here AAP supporter @VishalDadlani says the song was sung by Lata ji for Nehru ji in 1947. Hello @SonyTV how do you allow this AAPiya 🤣   https://t.co/NjbvHUnlUi

Hard to see it as anything other than an aesthetic and gender based judgment--he's our reassuring grandfather and she's easier to spoof on SNL. I am not anti-Fauci, but he's made his own misjudgments along the way, but they are always laid down to Trump whereas hers are not.

@SpooF___ @NAMELESS There’s a difference between a good fight and having marketing/advertising advantage. Obviously Mcgregor sells out arenas, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t “any good fights” lol. There’s plenty of good fights in the making that sell out without the name “mcgregor”.

i spent forever trying to figure out what font they use for crayola’s logo so i can make a spoof of it to decorate our classroom door and then remembered that the only people who will see this...are two....
@ping_spoof @LegacyKillaHD What happened in TLOU1 that would really need a sequel?
Another evening where I am just astonished at how closely and with such expertise Westminster journalists are following American politics. Contemplating live tweeting the whole imminent CDU congress that might decided the next German Chancellor in such detail as a giant spoof...
@MikeCarlton01 Its like a spoof skit from Saturday Night Live
Looking forward to talking to my old friend ADAM POST @comicswelove at 6pm PST about Parody Press &amp; Spoof Comics back in the day.  Come on and let's get happy! #xfarce #epicmermaids

@JonnElledge It's impossible to tell which makes it a very clever spoof if it is one or shows how close he is to self-parody if it isn't.
While there is no Channel5 sponsor, it would be hilarious to have some spoof Neighbours sponsors... “Neighbours is proudly sponsored by Rebecchi Law. No Win, No.... well, just No Win really.” #Neighbours
Then in 1964 Frazetta's career took another turn: United Artists had been impressed by a Ringo Starr spoof Frazetta had done for Mad Magazine, and so they asked him to create a movie poster for the film What's New Pussycat. It paid handsomely.  https://t.co/W9WQhWN8LQ

Last 12mths shows you don't need to spoof the market with placings that people claim they're not in, or discounted pre IPO seed money or off market.transactions or ponzi schemes   A bit of hard work and honest research   More rewarding too
No a crime was committed and those involved must face justice. A Supreme Court Justice is murdered and it’s covered up. This is crime and must be investigated. Too many players involved spoof them out and they’ll sing like Song Byrd McClain!!

@RealiaAmelia I love how when HBomberguy made a video about this show he mentioned that this scene looks like if he want to make a spoof of Sherlock. Like, it's so ridiculous it might as well me a parody of itself

@MichaelCormier1 @RAF_Luton Some spoof accounts tiptoe right up to the line of deception with parody so subtle it's nigh-indistinguishable.  @RAF_Luton is -not- one of those accounts.

I thought this was a spoof at first.
@bob_bs1234 @RAF_Luton @RAF_Luton is one of my favourite spoof accounts. 😄
Kinda goes without saying he'd agree.  I'm sure Johnson could spoof Starmer by leaking to Kuennservativeberg that he's going to behead the first born in every family to sate the gods and drive off Covid and ten minutes later Keith would be on @SkyNews advocating it as policy.
Good point in the thread below.   What’s in a name?  For starters, the difference between the real deal and a fake, spoof, or forgery.    All #Ravencoin asset names are unique.    When transacting in a name built on the @Ravencoin platform, you know it is the real McCoy.  https://t.co/efPziLS9bc
@LightsCameraPod This looks like a spoof trailer inside another movie like Tropic Thunder
I'm putting in my 1 trillion to buy market Market On Close order to spoof the market
So @peterkyle has now invented a *wholly new reality* in which Keir Starmer has been demonstrating 'foresight' and demanding schools be closed, and this is not a joke or a spoof or a parody account, this is a real, living, breathing member of the Starmer not-a-cult. Just bizarre.
When I wonder how gullible some people can actually be, I look at the indignant replies to obviously spoof tweets from a parody account &amp; I marvel.  If critical thinking existed, @RAF_Luton would be made redundant, but the comedic genius behind that acct has a very bright future
@SmokingSkills_ kitna simple but valuable baat hai

First time watching KAMPUNG PISANG BERSIRI SIRI + I actually enjoyed it.  Apart from its tongue in cheek criticisms on Malay society, it’s pays homage + spoof on popular TV series + movies from the 70s + 80s - from High Chapparal, Combat to Donny &amp; Marie show. And Patrick Swayze  https://t.co/0dUPYWSMxb

So many things 1 must be a spoof, surely? 2 should be amen and awomen, not awoman, surely 3 at least it wasn't a men and amenstruator, i guess 4 if not a spoof, can somebody please explain to me, with pictures, why this isn't just the worst timeline?
Yikes, this is a staggeringly bad idea from a government that's usually extremely smart- even if they have their own unique way of doing things.  @bunniestudios would it be hard to spoof the hardware token? Could you incriminate someone by placing them at the scene of a crime?
This is a spoof right? 😂 It has to be surely? Aside from anything else ‘Amen’ is derived from the Hebrew word āmēn which means ‘so be it’ or  ‘verily’ or ‘truth’. It has nothing to do with gender 😄
@ddale8 Clear as mud. Please," oh please let @sarahcpr spoof ""the call."""

I have NEVER seen the trope played straight in a major studio feature.  I HAVE seen the trope played straight with a *male* victim and *female* rescuer(s), though.  When the mustachioed villain/maiden version shows up, it is invariably a broad comedy spoof.  https://t.co/lhInmjrbuG

I’m willing to bet that a fair few of the people who complained about a (fairly accurate) spoof report that the tale of God impregnating Mary was done without her prior consent were also screaming free speech when the BBC substituted Fairytale Of New York   https://t.co/rFZjr7P0Ls

@EmmaKennedy I read a spoof tweet that started like that - a sinkhole appearing in a lorry park in Kent - but finished with 'government ministers are looking into it'. So, when first saw this one, I was waiting for the punchline. Which never came. And people say you couldn't make it up. ❤

@Sparrlyten @SoniaPoulton Are these spoof responses? Isn't this what we've been told since last April? And have you not noticed how much we've been conditioned to expect the vaccines NOT to work? Matt Fuckwit now says 2021 will still need restrictions.
@adamgarriereal Honestly, I when I saw you quoted I could not believe that it was not a spoof. In twitter's crowded field of, sad to say, male idiocy, you emerge a clear winner today.
@GrayConnolly @HGM_Wien About 20 of us were on ‘stoppage of leave’ for committing a long forgotten sin. #SoundOfMusic came on in the rec room. The sound was turned down and two of the fellas provided an ‘alternate spoof commentary.’ The fillum has never been the same since.  #flicksnochills

"Fancy made it easy for folk with FBI contracts to spot them; their 2-step method was lit in neon: 1) Spoof a website of a western target. 2) Phish for log-ins or w/ xAgent loaded docs. Each website was both a forewarning of ""Putin's intent"" &amp; a lasting memorial of it."
