@thugcrowd @donk_enby Give us this day our daily SQLi character escapes, and lead us not into cross site request forgery, but deliver us from cross site scripting, for thine is the gold tower, the hyperpartisanship, and grifting forever, maga.
So an interesting side effect is that in order for your page to work the way you expect, you're pushed into  http best practices (whether you know it or not), which then ensures your SameSite cookies actually protect you from CSRF (no mutations in GET).
In @remix_run we have two primary server side hooks:  loader (for GET) action (for POST and friends)  This isn't just nice to think about, but things like SameSite cookies are designed with the assumption you aren't going to log somebody out with a GET, opening up CSRF attacks.

@_martinthoma the beauty of CSRF and what sets it apart from other bug classes in my opinion is the fact that it can be used to attack web sites to which the attacker doesn‚Äôt even have access. So isolation - which solves essentially all other security issues - does not help.
CVE-2021-24085 is about a user w/ the ‚ÄúExchange Server Certificates‚Äú role that can access the root cert w/ private key and generate CSRF tokens. Those tokens can be used to trigger a CSRF attack that could lead to an account takeover and the vector could be delivered via email.

"What does ""Cross Site"" mean in Cross Site Scripting / Cross Site Request Forgery? Wrong answers only. #infosec"
@stokfredrik Totally depends on the action that is being performed by the CSRF. Most commonly P2/P3.
@hakluke From what I found, mostly #CSRF are GET based, on many functions 1. App functions + burp while checking every endpoint is a deadly combo 2. Understanding the app flow and their functions is the key 3. Also check the response if x-csrf header is allowed then it help's in bypassing
- Try building the payload with multiple methods including a standard HTML form, multipart form, and XHR (Burp can help)  Being thorough is the key - many devs are still implementing CSRF protections on a per-endpoint basis. When they do that, they're bound to forget somewhere!
There is still SO MUCH CSRF to find in bounty programs.  CSRF comes in many forms. Try:  - Removing the token parameter entirely - Setting the token to a blank string - Changing the token to an invalid token of the same format - Using a different user's token  More in thread üëá

How your website will be hacked if you have no CSRF protection  https://t.co/Sh5P56ApBi
In my opinion (take it for what little it‚Äôs worth), the realistic (I‚Äôm not burning an 0-day) threat of QR codes is mostly CSRF related.  A QR CSRF exploit can only be effective if many people are logged in to a popular service that is vulnerable to CSRF (tiny attack surface).
The script keeps web requests to a bare minimum. One request to grab the CSRF token, then one additional request each time you click a part. Part data is cached until you hit refresh, even if you navigate between result pages.
The reason this works is because TM (&amp; GM) scripts can make exclusions to the cross-origin security policy, in order to pull the CSRF token from the LCSC webpage and then make API requests to their servers.
